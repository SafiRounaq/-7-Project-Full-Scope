Blog App — Next.js + MongoDB
Project Overview
The Blog App is a full-stack blogging platform built using Next.js and MongoDB. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts efficiently. The application uses Next.js 14 for server-side rendering, Mongoose for database management, and Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design. Axios handles API communication, while React Toastify provides smooth user notifications, resulting in a functional and polished blogging experience.
